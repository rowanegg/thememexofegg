# Digital, Electronic Computers: Competences & Social Necessities

### Competences

***Machine ratiocinatrix verus nulla nunc celebrior clamorosiorque secta quam Catesinorum***

- If you can build a machine that thinks, it therefore must have a mind
- The idea that you can build a machine that changes what it does based on its own calculations is an idea not solved until **1936**

- **Alan Turing**
	- New age of speedy publishing, development of ideas
	- Need to systematize what is going on
	- Idea that if we can put all this math into one system of things that can be proved, we will know everything
	- Comes up with thought experiment, *Turing machine*
		- Thinking of problem in series of steps, to see what can be done/if the problem can even be solved
		- Each observation that human computer makes changes a state of mind
		- Machine can read, write, scan, and remember series of binary
		- Enables him to identify such a problem
		- Machine can compute any computable problem, *if* he can express it properly
		- First to publish this idea, but there were many others working on the same ideas, publishing similar work within months of Turing, despite being isolated from the other
		- What are the things percolating in the ether?
		- The machine depends on Boolean algebra

- **Shannon again & telephone relays/exchange**
	- Focus on how accurately a message can be relayed
- When combining info theory with Turing's universal computer, you have a way to simulate any work that can be done by a human computer
- 'Electronic brains' start hitting pop culture in 40s and 50s

- **Back to Babbage**
	- Turing drawing inspo from his work
	- Use of punch cards w instructions and data
	- Babbage used info from silk industry
	- Souped up calculators -> stage leading to digital computation despite dying out in WW2
	- No social necessity for Babbage's machine
- Emergence of modern corporation post Civil War

- **Tide Prediction Machine + Tabulators**
	- Parallel kinds of 'computing devices'
	- Kevin's tide calculator for dif points around the world
	- Kevin proposes in 1876 a way of linking several similar devices together physically to simulate differential equations
	- the mechanisms to achieve this not developed until the 1920s... and Vannevar Bush
	- If people are numbers, they cease to be human...
	- We don't need computers for business, nor science
	- Analog computers
	- 'Programming' these machines:
		- Literally bashing them into different shapes with hammers and wrenches
		- Useful for scientific analysis

- **George Stibitz (Bell Labs) - 1937**
	- Builds first complex calculator - Model 1
	- Does a demo in Dartmouth, model 1 is in NYC, runs demo via telephone
	- First time computing device is activated over telephone wire
	- builds 4 specialized calculators during the war, each one more sophisticated than the next
	- Rendered obselete in 1950s by pure electronic calculation

- **Konrad Zuse** -1936
	- Relieved of active duty, sent back to work with instructions to build calculator for missiles -> Z4
	- in '45', Zuse flees with Z4, is captured

- **Howard Aitken - same time as Zuse**
	- Harvard. electronic calculator to help with thesis work, brings to military in 1937
	- Military says no, even though its own reviewing engineer wanted it, refers Aitken to IBM and Thomas Watson (president)
	- Watson agrees to fund Aitken
	- In 1939, Navy and IBM make him a naval commander and give green light to run machine
	- First machine, Mark 1
	- Similar to Z3 or Bell model 2

*Existing 'social necessity' good enough for electrico-mechanical calculators*

### Ballistics

- Industrialization of War over 19th century - new guns
- Reverend Francis Brashforth produces first firing tables
- US military in aftermath of civil war establishes testing range to train ballistifc officers
- Tables calculated by typically women, by hand
- 15 tables produced per week, upwards of 40 needed

**Mauchly & ENIAC**
- [HiddenFigures](HiddenFigures.md)
- [ShiftPerspectives](ShiftPerspectives.md)
- [@lightWhenComputersWere1999sourcenote](@lightWhenComputersWere1999sourcenote.md)
- Electrical number integrator and Calculator/Computer
- Frequent use of women for work
- Mauchly's secretary recreates memo from notes, they take it to Oswald, who falls off his chair and says 'give him the money!'
- Programming the machine the night before, studying the diagrams made by engineers, reverse-engineering the whole thing
- Machine runs answer
- the programmers are not invited
- The role of the women were (are) ignored

**Grace Hopper**
- Maths prof at Vasser
- During the war, she joins the Navy, they send her to Aitken, who gives her *shit*
- He gives her one week to get equations on the machine with no diagrams or extra info
- Grace Hopper worked with machines at the level of pulses of electricity
- Eventually brings together businesspeople, sits down, and designs language for them to use so their machines are inoperable (Coble)
- Studies wiring diagrams
- Interrogates engineers
- "Writes the freakin' manual"
- DOESNT GET HER NAME ON IT??????
- She finds the first bug in the machine
- Fly broke everything up
- 'The Eniac Six'
	- 6 female engineers
	- keeping track of diagrams manually
	- wrote first algorithms that could write other algorithms
	- All in positions of authority, no credit received
	- Company still cannot convince others to buy it
	- Rand corporation buy it in 1950, women must report to inexperienced male superiors
	- The 6 must do that job themselves
	- Projected 2 would sell in a year, the women sold 42 in 2 years
	- Managed tax payments, building, programming
	- *The work that no one valued gets coded female early on*
	- They end up training their male replacements once money is involved
	- They were even ignored in the anniversary of the ENIAC 

**We are now in period of digital incunabula**

- Missing supervening social necessity? Nuclear War
