### Summary & Key Take Aways

In his work, Standage (1998) discusses the legacy of the telegraph, as well as the societal effects it left in its wake. To begin, he shares the aftermath of some of the telegraph's greateast contributors; Cooke, Morse, and Wheatstone, who go on to other projects before their deaths. Then, the author explains the telegraph's eventual replacement by the telephone, wherein they quickly become a household item.
Standage (1998) aims to highlight the elements of telegraphs seen in the Internet today, from technological pieces to the public's reaction. He argues that although the telegraph was replaced, it will never truly disappear from society. In other words, old technology will always inspire and be improved upon by new inventions. Technology never completely dies, as it continues to play a large role in building future designs.
