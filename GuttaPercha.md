While Gutta Percha is one of the main resources talked about in class, a quick google search can find that with industrialization comes the vast destruction of a desired commodity. One could look at the violent killings of harbor seals in present day, or the past and cotinued slaughter of whale populations for their blubber. Since capitalism requires such high volumes of commodity, corporations are willing to obtain as much as possible with little consideration to any possible consequences.
