> - **Abstract:** The paper discusses the evolution and development of library catalogues from clay tablets to theweb-based catalogue. In the early stages, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice. Eachlibrary constructed its own catalogue, most suited to its purpose. A series of continuous changes throughthe ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputsadded various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may functionlike a portal and this function can be exploited infi nitely to connect to a variety of data considered usefulfor library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based cataloguesinitiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages. The faceliftof the simple catalogue was eminent to keep up with the versatile needs of the widely web-exposedlibrary users.

Then, the author delves into the first known method of recording bibliographic information found on clay tablets, then progressing though time as the catalogue develops. Kumar describes the constant change of library catalogues, morphing from an entity controlled by the Church to a completely accessible, user friendly OPAC system.
