Tech billionaires today are frequently painted as heroic bottom-up 'man of the people' figures, however when examing the stories of Bezos, Musk, and Zuckerberg, it is found that they all had rich upbringings, went to top schools, and received various large grants. Is this because, similarly to Dewey, the people who can control and distrort our perspectives are those of rich white men? What other public figures are painted in this way, only to have experienced the complete opposite?
