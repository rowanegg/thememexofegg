# Electric History

- Mushrooms can communicate using over 50 electrical signals
- Not abnormal - lots of animals can create electricity
	- ex. Electric catfish
- Ancient folks were aware of electricity, and the power some animals have to generate it
	- Not aware that lightining, static electricity, generated were all same thing
- *Jump to 18th century
- Galvani was curious about the 'vital spark', thing that makes a person alive vs not alive
	- Sets up experiement w bottom halves of frogs on small hooks, moving close to charged glass balls
	- Assistant (who??) has calibers touches from leg to nerves, leg moves, holy shit!
	- Process known as **galvanism**, aka getting to move
- Practice of medecine is becoming more yay
	- Need to provide practice corpses (grave robbers? How else?)
	- Process of 'making' corpses by Burke and Hare
		- Caught, executed, Burke's skin made into a book
		- Lots of public dissections and experiments
		- Had to be corpses of good quality (no rich, upstanding people, only homeless, poor, workhouse, no power) #power
- George Forrester
	- Wife and child died, most likely murder-suicide
	- Forrester was found guilty, most likely innocent in reality
	- Sentenced to death by hanging (PAINFUL)
	- When Forrester goes on gallows, his friends are underneath, will grab his legs and ensure job is done right
	- Body is up for experimentation, Galvani's nephew (follows uncle's ideals)
		- Gets Forrester's body, public exhibiy of process
		- Lots of spasming
- Offered idea that it was possible to bring back from dead
- **MARY SHELLEY!!**
	- Frankenstein, the monster is the doctor, using galvanation to raise the dead
**Back it up, what about the Greeks?**
- Belief that all things have a soul
- Took behaviour of magnets as evidence
- Rubbing amber with wool, static energy
- Always been connection between electricity and life - cultural ideas of [[commonsense]][[perspective]]
**- Leyden jars** - 1746
- Attempt to capture electricity in jar
- Water in bottle with witre attached to gun, glass balls nearby that rubbed
- Calls assistant over, asks him to grab the glass bottle, charge becomes concentrated
- Capacitor - way of storing electrical charge?
- Lots of experimentation with uncovering more about electricity
- Ben Franklin, demonstrating that lightning and electricity are the same
	- Noticed if you make a cone of iron, you can direct where charge goes
	- Lightning conductors
- Volti disagrees with Galvani due to moisture, conflict/competition influencing development
	- Pile of metal rounds, demonstrating electricity pile
	- First battery
- Figuring out how to communicate with other scholars
- Different progressions happening in different places
- Faraday learns that magnets induce electricity
- Ideas of relays/switches - **Joseph Henry**
- Collapsing of space/time!!!
- Transforming society, social shortcuts [development](development)
**Telegraphs**
- Can't just string a wire from A-B
	-Must consider circuits
	- Just in time for steam powered railways to begin
	- Note - new inventions co-evolving due to societal influence

**WHAT AM I MISSING?
WHAT OTHER STRUCTURES EXIST
Who are the assistants? [HiddenFigures](HiddenFigures.md)

Research:
1. Vital Spark
2. Space-time convergence
3. 'cruel' history 1800s
4. Co-evolution of inventions
