## No "Birth of the Internet" with computers talking to each other!!!

#### Oct 29, 1969 = 'birth of the Internet'

- Not one single moment, a series of events over decades
- Phase transition in technologies and ways of thinking of technologies
- This date could be one of the first 'bubbles' in a boiling pot

### The Problem

- Building history around an American internet creates a Whiggish ideology
- Triumphalism ending with NA democracy
- Conservative way of telling history
- History told with *end goal* in mind
- Overly Simplistic
- [ShiftPerspectives](ShiftPerspectives.md)

### One network does not an internetwork make!

- *Inter*network of computers/systems
- Where are the others coming from?

#### France

- Need for domestic atomic agenda for nuclear weapons to maintain democracy
- Irritated by Americans owning critical companies
- Sees work on the IMP and British progress, jump into packet switching
- Creating the CYCLADES - 1971
- fully operational 1976
- Led by Louis Pouzin
- Coins term data-gram (data +telegram)
- Gets hosts to do error correction, not the routers (in ARPANET routers do the opposite)
- Makes hosts responsible for delivery of data on a 'best-effort' means
- Routers ensure transparency end-to-end 
- Simplifies interconnectivity
- Explicitly designed from the outset to connect different netowrks together (unlike ARPANET)

#### ALOHANET

- UHawaii - main campus near Honolulu
- 1968 Eng department started planning a way to broadcast data over radio instead of wire
- Permit sharing of main campus computer
- Technical issues solved and goes into use June 1971

#### SATNET

- Watching Seismic information (missile launches)
- Proposal from Larry Robers to connect ARPANET to National Physical Laboratory

#### Everywhere else in Europe:

- European Informatics network
- Aim to share resources
- promote computer science
- Proposed in '71, working by '76
- **What is going on everywhere else?**

#### Hippies in San Francisco Bay

- Push for reform in Bay Area
- Resource One: Warehouse in SF taken over by hippies, communally running together
- Everyone is living in little pods, lots of experimentation happening
- underground telephones (switchboards) happening
- Figuring out what online culture is before it even existed

#### How do we keep track of things on the web?

- Starting out as women's work since it was seen as less important
- **Elizabth 'Jake' Feindler**
- Information chemist
- Eventually develops 'handbook'
- Resources at every host
- Responsible technological admin
- 1000 pages, record of every node, insitution, and person who together made ARPANET
- Creates directory, every person on the arpanet and how to find them
- Registers all new hosts, documentation, and how-tos
- Coded feminine

- History of the Internet is **not** the history of tech, its the history of people!
- Prescence of women becomes to be seen as a threat

- '69-'73 period of ferment
- Other networks starting up, dif ways of implementing new ideas

### To research:

- Different countries' perspectives
