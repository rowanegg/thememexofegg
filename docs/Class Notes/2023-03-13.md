## Competences are here!

- Info theory allows us to separate meaning of a message from information, measure its redundancy
- Imaginative leaps/conceptual steps forward emerged


### Timesharing

- Technique for using the speed of the computer to present the appearance of multiple simultaneous users
- Terminal - a keyboard/teletype/whatever for transmitting instructions, displaying results
- Not a purely technical issue
- **But which computer to use**?
- How to move things around - problems of communications

### Packet Switching

- Developed *independently* in US and UK at the same time
- Only one of these was framed as the context of surviving nuclear war
- Movies emerging from fear of nuclear war
- Money being poured into research

#### **Paul Baron**

- Engineer at Rand Corporation, begins thinking about secure communications
- Starts looking at current telecommunications
- Message switching
	- Figuring out flow control isn't new!!
	- Similar to telegraphs [Immortality](Immortality.md)
- AT & T don't see much value in his words, build military network on top of civilian network
- In service until the 1990s
- Distributed nodes who don't operate on their own - surrounding central control system
- In Baron's system, the node was its own computer system - deciding where to send things

### UK Political Context

- Two dead white men!!
	- Harold Wilson's fear of losing out on teh
	- Donald Davis, National Physical Laboratory
	- Making sure women and minorities lose access to their work in favour of white men
	- Repetition of 'right kind' of people

### IBM 2741 ca 1965

- Direct connection in adjacent rooms at first
- Then local phone lines
- Long distance rates interfere
- High cost of communication makes users work fast, undermines purpose of timesharing

- Davis unveils packetswitching in 1966 at a conference
- Learns from British military officer afterwards that it's already been invented by Baran
- Baran uses words like 'survivable', 'kill'
- Post office says no!
- Builds Mark One that connects labs, goes online in 1967
- Merging for **control**

### Meanwhile, Back in the US

- ARPA created 1957
- AT&T greet Baran's ideas with hostility; Defence Communication Agency populated with telephone people, Baran's idea dead in the water
- Lyndon Johnson in 1965 directed agencies to support basic university research, and that centers of excellence should be created throughout the university
- **Lawrence Roberts - manager, ARPANET project, 1966**

- ARPA calls a meeting in 1967 if computer scientisrs with an interest in computerized communications
- Programming 'mini' computers using packet switching
- First RFQ for the ARPANET - August 1968

### First IMPS

- 6 ft tall
- First for IMPS, $360k each
- Programming to make them work: $640k
- IBM not impressed
- Coming from Honeywell, but must be customized
- Only company in play: Bolt. Beranek, and Newman
	- LickLider just happened to have worked for them in the 50s
- How do you make this thing 'a router?' How do you make packet switching work?
- Fewer of the hardened Cold War survival features
- More high-speed transmission, adaptive routing

**Not just the Internet, The same structures gives us... The Mother of All Demos**

- SRI, December, 1968
	- Douglas Englebart demonstrations the 'NLS', online system
	- Invention of mouse, anything that involves the cloud

- By 1968-9 things are working fast
- BBN working on honeywells, routing algorithms, protocols for IMPS
- main frame teams form themselves into a Network Making Group
- decentralization
