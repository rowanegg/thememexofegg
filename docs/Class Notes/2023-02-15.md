- Social necessity pushes invention
	- Also responsible for multiple people inventing same thing at same time
	- Things will accelerate/deccelerate use
- Railroads discover that telegraphy is not needed

**Accelerating forces**
- The stock market is invented (the corporation)
	- Purpose of financing the railroads
	- Between 1830s and 1860s, companies start via buying and selling of stocks

	- Repurposed for *Newspapers* which emerge in 19th century
	- Not interested in ethics, interested in what sells
	- Using information from other newspaper editors
	- **Compression of Space and Time**
	- Henry O'Reilly gets rights to run Morse powered telegraphs
	- Cooke and Wheatstone have American patents prior to Morse
	- Competing services
	- Eventually Morse is triumphant
	- American government's did not intervene
		- **What was the Canadian approach?** 
- Only three companies survived

**International Telegraphy**
- Money can be made if messages go across bodies of water
- Scheme to cross the atlantic emerges
- Wire stops working in middle of ocean, machine that pays out cable snaps, 300 miles lost
- This time two boats, splice middle, cable also breaks
- Summer of 1858 uses same plan, works!

- Chief engineer on the Atlantic side was experimenting with making the sound clearer
	- Turns nob up too high, fries system
- Cable quality develops quickly
- **Space on a global scale has been annihilated**
	- Communications across countries
	- **Telegraphs and colonialism?**

		-  Indian Mutiny 1857
- Industrialization of wires
	- Gutta percha - tree gum
	- Europeans knew about it for centuries, turns out it is easy to stretch/mold when heated
	- Opens market for making most things we now make out of plastic
	- Electrically resistant, great insulator
	- By the 20th century, 88 million trees destroyed
