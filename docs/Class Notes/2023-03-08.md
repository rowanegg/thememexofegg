# Computational Incunabula: The British Experience

## Colossus 

- Developped during WWII
- Emerges from the Bombe
- Never fully declassified until well after war
- Supervenening necessity: German wolfpack
- Started encrypting clues into the TIMES crossword puzzle
- Reliance on 'old boys' network

### Enigma

[Privacy](Privacy.md)
- Provides sense of privacy for commercial messages
- Goes back to **Arther Sherbius**
	- Substitution cypher
	- If you can change wiring with each keystroke, you have polyalphabetic subsitution cypher
	- Hard to break without help of a machine
	- By the 30s, every military branch is using one of these machines
	- Sharing knowledge with british and french
	- Polish codebreakers bring a souped up calculator

### Hut 8 & Bletchly Park

- British understood broad conceptual ideas
- Working on improved bombs
- No room for experimentation - had to break the code
- The Germans used plaintext words to signal starting and stopping
- Radio operators may screw up - forgetting to turn on a rotary
- Bombe churns through probabilities
- Sending coordinates and other messages to british ships
- Germans add another rotor onto encryption machine
- British don't know for certain
- Full story is never known - still have classified info from this period

### Bombe to Colossus

- Turing's teacher, Max Newman, leads design of Colossus
- Could suggest best match for pattern within text
- Second colossus could figure out which pattern to try
- Integrating valves the key
- Neutralizing german encryption

### Post War Developments: Doldruks

[SupplyDemand](SupplyDemand.md)
- Multiple teams exploring these machines that sit on calculator/computer barrier
- Urgency is gone; everyone losing steam in terms of compuing design
- Newman writes draft of report on EDVAC


### From One Supervening Necessity To Another

- Project Whirlwind
	- Analogue computer simulating flight on multiple kinds of airplanes being developed during war
- Most expensive of the various computing projects; navy loses interest
- Airforce takes over; the only machine that could plot intercept courses for strategic long range bombers
- Solves problem of magnetic memory
- COLD WAR starts (buh buh bahhhhhhh)
	- Soviets detonate atomic bomb 1949
	- Americans detonate H bomb
	- Needed lots of computing
	- All unique - needed to learn everything from scratch
		- [HiddenFigures](HiddenFigures.md)
		- Joe Thompson - first African American man to work on these machines; what was his story??
		- NEVER accept photographs at face value


### Meanwhile in Britain

- Manchester Baby
	- Tiny computer
	- Test computers
	- Core of commercial computer
- Built to test another solution to the problem of memory
- Runs a stored program from memory in 1948 - another 'first computer' moment
- Could make claim that it is 'the first real computer'

### Allies no longer sharing information

- Act of Congress in 1946 closes off data sharing with allies over nuclear work
- Britain sets out to build its own expertise
- Decides that all such experiments ought to be centralized at the National Physical Laboratory
- The 'official' British Computer built at NPL, and they turn to Turing to make it 'Automatic Computing Engine'
- Turing can't explain *why* computers matter due to Secrets Act

### Death of Alan Turing

- Moves to Manchester 1948
- His house is burgled - he calls to police. In course of investigation, Turing is forced to admit he is homosexual. 1952
- He was found guilty of gross indecency; imprisonment or probation with chemical castration
- Loses security clearances. chooses castration (high dosages of estrogen)
- Commits suicide 1954
- Pardoned in 2012
- Man who saved Britain dehumanized, condemmed under Buggary Laws that are not appealed util 2003
- Gov. more concerned about indecency
- Idea of 'the wrong people', aka not cis white rich men evicerates computing industry
- Had the women train 'the right kinds of men' to take over their own jobs
- *Potential future research - Alan Turing's story*

### Period of Digital Incunabula is Over

- Commercial versions of 'Manchester Baby' being sold by Ferranti corporation
as general purpose business computers
- By 1952, IAS machine comes online
- Digital age begins
- "There will never be enough problems, enough work for more than one or two of these computers... stop this foolishness with Eckert and Mauchly" - Aitken, who probably ate his words later
- Canadian early computing?
- Woman formerly connected with Queens U went to U of T and set up computer science program

### IBM Finally Gets On The Act

- Incidentally on some accounts, this is when the digital humanities are born
- When Rand starts selling UNIVAC computers, they start following Newman's plan, releasing it as 701
- Idea of re using/upgrading existing calculators

### Programming is Still an Issue

- Every computer has its own wiring, circuits, designs, idiosyncracies
- People like Grace Hopper are building compilers and higher level languages to ease programming and provide some inoperability
- Mostly male programmers liked the secrecy of the way things were
	- Helps them maintain their position of power
	- High priesthood effect
- Not much security, relying on effect that computers are 'too hard'

### Is it time for the Internet yet?

- Existence of digital computers
- Existence of telecomm networks
- Info theory
- Ideas around flow control, logic, algorithms
- "System designed to prevent breakdown during Cold War"
	- **The truth is more nuanced**
