Alan Turing was a pioneer in the Turing Machine that led to major future developments, but the moment he was outed as homosexual he is treated as a pariah. His rejection from his career is a key indicator of Social Blindness: The moment someone embodies something that society doesn't want to see, those around them immediately become blind to any other possible facet of their identity.
