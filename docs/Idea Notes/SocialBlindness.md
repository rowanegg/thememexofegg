Alan Turing was a pioneer in the Turing Machine that led to major future developments, but the moment he was outed as homosexual he is treated as a pariah. His rejection from his career is a key indicator of Social Blindness: The moment someone embodies something that society doesn't want to see, those around them immediately become blind to any other possible facet of their identity. 

Although I didn't quite get the time to fully delve into Turing's story, a great article following his story is [@doanQueerHistoryQueer2017](@doanQueerHistoryQueer2017.md) .
