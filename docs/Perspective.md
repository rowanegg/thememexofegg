In Wiegand's article, a theme that frequently appears throughout Dewey's journey is that of a skewed perspective. The author frequently refer's to Amherst College's conservative stance, in addition to how Dewey wholeheartedly agreed with their values. The author states that, **"Dewey largely tapped Harris's structure as the broad blueprint for his own decimal scheme (in order?philosophy, theology, sociology, philology, natural science, useful arts, fine arts, literature, and history)****" (Wiegand: 1998, pg.9). Dewey's classification system was therefore distorted by what the white Western perspective deems to be useful, ranking philosophy and religion higher than the social sciences. In other words, most libraries now organize books in a way that prioritizes Catholic cultural ideas, potentially obstructing or complicating access to other, 'less important' topics. The organizations in power take control over the displayed perspective, thus shaping how future generations form ideas and act in society.
