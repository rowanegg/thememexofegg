### Summary & Key Take Aways

In the article, Lubar (1992) discusses the events of a post-IBM society, from its rise in popularity to eventual replaement. To begin, he describes American society's perspective on the cards, and its dual meaning as a symbol of both beaurocratic power and protest. Lubar states that the IBM reflected the combination of beaurocracy and civic life in many cases, holding a sense of power over citizens.
	However, the IBM is also a representation of revolution, and the fight against 'The Big Man'. Lubar tells the story of UC Berkley students, wherein they protest the dehumanization associated with punch cards. Pulling inspiration from the burning of draft cards in Vietnam, the punch cards were publicly destroyed, soon coining the phrase ' Do not fold, spindle, or mutliate' to symbolize their collective dissent. The author quickly notes the demeaning history of IBM use, decribing how Nazis in death camps would also register their prisoners using punch cards. The article is finally closed highlighting culture's desire to avoid becoming a number, battling to regain a sense of humanity in a cold, capitalistic society.
