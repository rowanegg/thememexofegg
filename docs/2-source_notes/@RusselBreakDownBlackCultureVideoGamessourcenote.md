### Summary & Key Take Aways

Black culture is rarely recognized as an influence on video game evolution, however the transcript of a conversaion between Russworm and Holmes (2021) aims to uncover some of the missing pieces. The two figures first discuss the relationship between black culture and the arcade scene, noting the overlap with b-boying and hip hop battles both in and outside gaming. Since black culture in video games is the main focus of thr discussion, Jerry Lawson's monumental influences are discussed, highlighting that without him, the industry would be substantially further behind. Finally, Holmes (2021)  describes his podcast *Spawn On Me*, with the goal of creating an inclusive space for marginalized people in the gaming scene. This conversation breaks down the white-centric perspective on video gaming, ensuring that black culture's influences on such a large part of modern day life are respected.
