### Summary & Key Take Aways

In the article by Doan (2017), the author discusses Alan Turing's queer identity, as well as how he is viewed by society today versus reality. After briefly covering different time-perspectives show by historians, Doan (2017) reveals the focal point of his research, wherein Turing has been canonized as a queer martryr, losing focus of his true story. Then, the author explains modern-day pop culture surrounding Turing, from a movie leading to a royal pardon, to his description as a '"homo hero"' (Doan 2017, pg. 6). However, later on in the article, Doan (2017) shows that in interviews, Turing regarded his sexuality lightly, and openly joked about his chemical castration. In this sense, Turing's technological advances and personality are reduced to a broken man, who only suffered due to his queerness. Overall, Doan (2017) uses his research to discuss the dangers of collective memory, and how society can quickly lose sight of the truth via fetishization and dramatization of events. ^4d52a9
