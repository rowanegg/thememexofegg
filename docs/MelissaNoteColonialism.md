Melissa notes,
"without the [telegraph](https://ladylovelace02.github.io/Hist1900memex/AtomicNotes/telegraph/) colonial nations wouldn't have been able to expend to the extent they did without the mass amount of communications between local and foreign governments"

While this does not relate to my recent additions, I would like to link this to my previous notes on colonialism and the digital divide - while the telegraph did lead to an extended reach into the Global South, I find it interesting as to *why* these areas are so deprived of Internet and telephone lines today. This could potentially be researched further by looking into telegraph station and internet tower locations today.
