While reading and learning more about the dawn of video games, the main perspective discussed is centered around the white male experience, almost completely obscuring BlPOC figures from the discussion. The discussion between Russel and Holmes (2021) covers these underappreciated aspects of culture, placing emphasis on the influences of hiphop/b-boy motifs in video games. In this sense, the exploration of the relationship between black culture and video games increases the depth of our understanding on the topic, taking all parties into account.
