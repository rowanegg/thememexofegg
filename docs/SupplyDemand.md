A concept frequently discussed throughout the course is technology evolving hand in hand with the needs of culture, so what happens when society doesn't *want* new inventions? Many university students revolted against the dehumanizing nature of the punch card, however the system persisted until the digitization of IBM. It was evident that culture did not appreciate the bureaucratic control perpetuated by the punch cards, so why did they persist? Perhaps society has evolved to the point where the needs of the government, and therefore capitalism dominate the wants of the people, thus distorting the commonly accepted notion of the evolution of technology.
