Standage's (1998) article frequently emphasizes that technology never truly dies - it continues to inspire future generations. He writes that, **"There are even echoes of the earliest, most primitive telegraphs - such as the optical invented by Chappe - in today's modems and network hardware"** (Standage, 1998, p. 206). From societal reactions to the actual physical hardware, there are remnants of outdated technology everywhere, continuing on its legacy in a different form.
