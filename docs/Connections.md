As BITNET and NORTHNET's popularity grew in universites across the continent, a monumental theme seen through this development is the idea of a connection network. This technology greatly aided the academic community, providing **"an inexpensive, interactive electronic mail service among universities, thus permitting faculty staff and administrators to exchange messages, data, texts and computer programmes" (Kellerman 1986, pg. 2).** In this sense, access to information became easier to share, thus forming numerous complex links among researchers.
