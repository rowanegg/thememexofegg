With the invention of the telephone, Bell decided to hire young women to do the work of operators, connecting lines for customers. In order to avoid a repeat of constant line 'noise', Bell instilled a Foucault-inspired regime on his female operators, controlling everything from their voice to their diets. Carmi (2015) explains that **"Bell broke down the operating service into distinct repetitive stages and aimed to standardise them, while putting strong emphasis on speed"** (6). These women were trained to be automized smile machines for the customer, to the point where they were even sent out to 'entertain' male soldiers. Carmi's (2015) article notes a popular pattern to be explored in history; the expectation of women to uphold an unattainable standard that serves patriarchal ideals.
