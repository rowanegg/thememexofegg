One really interesting thing from the Doan (2017) article that stuck out to me was the idea of collective memory. The majority of stories told about Turing today paint him as a heroic gay icon, battered by society because of his identity. However, while Turing's identity was criminalized in reality, the author makes a very strong point that his life aside from that piece is completely forgotten. Doan (2017) notes that "Turing’s colleagues would many years later recollect a man with a mordant sense of humor, who responded to the forced feminization of his body 'with giggles” and carried documents pertaining to his court case in a file headed 'Burglary & Buggery'"" (pg. 11). To put it plainly, pop culture today only picks the aspects of Turing that are appealing to their cause, thus invalidating his work on the Turing machine, and his lighthearted approach to his queer identity. Collective memory distorts reality, leaving once hidden figures even more hidden in the name of social progression.
