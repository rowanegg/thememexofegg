Throughout Light's article, she displays the constant erasure of women in the evolution of programming. From numerous accounts having **"portrayed civilian jobs for women as appropriately feminine, "domestic" work for the nation despite the fact they were formerly done by men" (Light: 1999, pg. 8)**, to the complete erasure of their contributions to the ENIAC, men have the ability to distort the story, thus shifting the recognition to themselves. Computing is a field commonly associated with men, so why don't we know about the women who play a large role in its development? When analyzing historical events, it is important to **ask about who is being left out**, thus allowing a more diverse view on life.  ^eeb6ae
