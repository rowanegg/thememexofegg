As this course progresses, one can clearly identify the constant struggle for power as technology evolves. During WW2, the race to create the best encrypted telegraph increased in intensity, with the British government retaining **"cables in the event of war, knowing that its telegrams were secure as long as they traveled entirely on Britain's cables or those of its allies"** (Headrick, 2001, p. 36). For different nations, better technology symbolizes a one-up on their enemies in the event of war, thus they are able to maintain a sense of power.
