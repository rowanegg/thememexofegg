Access to libraries is a field that has widened over time, playing a large role in controlling literacy rates of the general population. Until the dispersion of mass-produced literature, books were reserved for monks and the elite nobility, thus limiting education for the middle class. Kumar explains, "**These monasteries played a major role in education as they were the primary places for preservation and production in the middle ages"** (Kumar: 2013, pg. 2). In other words, the Church had complete control over who *deserved* to learn. However; as libraries'  stocks grew, and the Church's hold on literacy began slipping, libraries started opening to the public, and education finally started becoming accessible. Technology as a whole consistently evolves to become more accessible to others, from electricity to the Dewey Decimal System. **No modern system appears out of a vaccuum**, so it is critical to understand the gradual development from point A to point B.
