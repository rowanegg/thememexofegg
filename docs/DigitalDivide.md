The fact that no one considered that laying Internet submarine cables over old telegraph ones could possibly reinforce colonial ideas is absurd to me. A large purpose of the telegraph is to facilitate communication and control in colonies, so *why* would corporations today continue that pattern, thus restricting Internet access to the Global South? In reality, we all know the answer behind that, being that those regions would not bring as much money and are therefore less important, however the article by Thorat (2019) explains the topic in more detail.
