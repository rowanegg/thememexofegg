When examining the interview between Bezos and Levy (2011), a theme that the interviewer excellently teases from the conversation is the widespread power over various industries held by Bezos and Amazon. While the topic of the interview is seemingly about Amazon's new tablet, the two men quickly spread out, describing how Bezos is part of the book, film, clothing, and technology industries, holding a lot of influence over the market. In other words, Levy (2011) uncovers that Amazon's quickly expanding product lines are taking control over smaller businesses, coming dangerously close to having a complete monopoly. If Bezos succeeds in doing this, he would be able to take over multiple markets, and would eliminate any diversity in competition.
