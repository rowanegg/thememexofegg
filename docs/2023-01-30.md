**Reflection on where we are going**
- Nonlinear
- Ask: What bits of the mushroom have we seen emerge?
	- Ask about interconnections in notes

**First Memex Assignment**
- Questions guiding readings 
	- Map of contents note

**Jacquard's the name, weaving's the game**
- Early looms found as early as the 5th millennia
- One of oldest technologies on Earth
- Deep roots are same words as tech
- Weaving is not a machine, as it is a social practice
	- Prostheses for further actions in social context
- Linen/Flax:
	- Can be turned into thread after beating
	- How did someone figure out these skills?
Silk:
- Made in northern China
- Again, how did someone know?
- *No one tech exists in a vaccuum, always other things influencing development*
- Leading to Silk Road, transporting disease
- Justinian I - wanted origins of silk

**Lyon**
- Louis XI establishes silk industry
	- Wants other goods associated with silk
		- Tech development as a result of other factors
	- Invades Italy, steals silk-weavers
- Francois I in 16th century funds improvement of silk-making machinery
- Not factories, individuals in their homes weaving 
- Could create effect of 'woven painting'
**Jacques de Vaucanson**
	- Duck machinery, could eat food, waddle around, then poop out the food
	- Rubberized intestine
**Jaquard**
	- Life bracketed around French Revolution
	- Was a monarchist
	- Escapes execution, becomes revolutionary
	- Returns penniless, father's inheritance having run out
	- Cult of rationality: what is more rational than a machine?
**Napoleon**
- Huge effort into fostering technical/scholarly innovation
- Brings scholars when he invades Egypt
- Putting money into innovation expos
- Jacquard uses said money to patent a loom that uses foot pedals, exhibits at Napoleon's second expo
- Wins medal, enters competition to improve fishnet making, designs loom for that
- What is the history of punch card making?
- Did Jacquard invent the punch card?
	- No - Louis Falcon had the draw boy hold the card in place manually
- Did Jacquard invent auto lifting of threads
- No - Vaucanson's metal cylinder's could do that
What *did* Jacquard invent
- Approach that applied threaded together punch cards to the auto control of the loom
	- 24 x increase!
	- Replicable patterns, complex patterns
	- Emergent phenomena of the socio-cultural life of Lyon
- What really matters about Jacquard's invention are the **cards** not the loom.
- Programmable, mechanical, external memory
- Seperation of Media
**Charles Babbage**
- Difference Engine/Analytical Engine
	- Difference bc it uses the method of differences to calculate tables by adding the differences between items in a series. But had to be set up manually; no cards
	- Well-to-do mathmetician, Could create 'perfect' tables
	- Never builds it!! Designs 1/7th, then brings it to soirees
		- Was only built in 2015
	- Babbage learns about Jacquard loom, recognizes card as data, a way to write out the intervening calculations, doing different equations
	- Similar to Ted Nelson in project Xanadu
	**Ada Lovelace**
	- Figures out how to program cards
**S Korsakov**
- Publishes method for searching info stored on punch cards
- Worked for Russian Police Ministry
- Work didn't get read in Anglosphere
**Hermin Hollerith**
- Joins faculty of MIT at 22, works for American Census
- BIL worked in silk industry
- Looks at cards, comes up with device to record card with different columns that the census is after
- Punching card
- Recent innovation of electricity, moving counter
- Will *Eventually* turn into digital computer
- 
What are the *threads* that came together?
What are the *Assemblages*
Who is *left out* of the story
What other questions does this story raise?
