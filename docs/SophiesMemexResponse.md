In Sophie's Memex, she makes a really good point about performative activism:

>"" and everyone would have known I was a good liberal and retweeted it to prove that they were good liberals"

Right off the bat I'm seeing a bit of commentary here about performative activism. Reminds me of a tweet I saw that said something along the lines of "(insert bad thing) can't be that bad, I haven't seen any instagram infographic stories on it yet"

- Their statement here really reminds me of how pop culture today views Alan Turing, wherein people support him on the surface but in reality, only really care for the 'interesting' part of his queerness that they imagine to be.
