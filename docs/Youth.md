The release of the WarGames film unlocked a frenzy in Cold War USA, calling for the need to place increased regulations on Internet use, specifically by minors. The use of teenaged computer use in media at the time encouraged parental restrictions, with WarGames having **"reminded viewers of the corruptibility of youth and suggested that hacker ethics, which were explicitly different from mainstream ethics, might spread from one youth to another" (Schulte 2008, pg. 13).** Adolescents are frequently painted as a threat to 'the right way', with their desires for change and innovation deemed dangerous.
