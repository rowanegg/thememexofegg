### Summary & Key Take Aways

In the article When Computers Were Women, Light discusses the role of women during World War II, as well as the erasure faced as men return to the workforce. In particular, she follows the story of the ENIAC, one of the first 'big' computer progressions of the 20th century. The author notes the distinct difference in nomenclature for the same job - wherein women's roles are diminished to a menial task. Similarly, Light also explains the highlighting of achievements of men in the media, blocking out the women who actually did the programming and mathematical work.
	Throughout the entire piece, a significant recurring theme is that of power and perspective. Much like the saying "the victors write the history books", those dominating the hierarchy have the ability to shape the story of an event. In other words, white men hold a position of power over women and people of colour, so therefore they can distort the story, thus placing themselves in the spotlight. The role of female programmers are diminished in the development of the ENIAC, their male superiors taking credit for the work of their highly-trained counterparts.
