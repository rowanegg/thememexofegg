### Summary & Key Take Aways

In his research paper, Headrick & Griset (2001) discusses the downfall of British imperialism through the development of telegraph cables. The authors first discusses the development and improvements made to the cables, allowing the British to facilitate better communication between colonies. Then, Headrick & Griset (2001) delve into the transatlantic telegraph development, running from Newfoundland to Ireland. The entrepreneurial race to cross the Atlantic begins, with various competitors attempting the feat. Finally, they indicate that this was the beginning of the commercialization of telegraphs, with WW2 increasing the need for speedy communication.
Competition is a theme seen frequently in Headrick & Griset's (2001) article, as various nations race to form the most advanced telegraph cables. It is clear to see that based on the information provided, technology is a symbol of power, allowing nations to hold power over their allies and enemies. In this sense WW2 escalates, the pressure to 'dominate' using the telegraph increases, thus proving its importance to society at the time. Overall, Headrick & Griset (2001) use their work to convey that technology cannot appear out of a vaccuum, there are a variety of cultural factors aiding and hindering its development.
