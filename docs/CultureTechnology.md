As discussed both in class and in the readings, technology doesn't emerge from a vacuum, it is heavily affected by society throughout time. On the other hand, new inventions influence culture, thus leading us into a 'chicken versus the egg' scenario. In order to answer this paradox, one should examine the progression of numerous technological developments, one of which found in Kumar's Clay Tablets article. The author describes the progression of library catalogues, from clay tablets to the fully digitized library systems. Through his research, it may be possible to find possible responses to whether culture changed technology, or vice versa.
