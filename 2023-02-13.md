- System of telegraphy
- Samuel *Morse* - Ring a bell?
- Lots of tech exist as assemblages, complex systems
- In the right conditions, complex systems can evolve
- **What are the right conditions?** Why did the electrical telegraph win out?
	- [CultureTechnology](CultureTechnology.md) [[2023-02-01]]
- **Brian Winston** - Historian of science
	- Developped framework to understand emergence of science
	- History is a tool for making past make sense in the present
	- If you're going to make an utterance about something, you need a background first/competence
	- **Technology is scientific performance**
	- Ideas enable transformation into technology
- Different inventors moving in same kinds of circles, pulling from same scientific competence
- **Supervening social necessity
- Technology is more than scientific base, there has to be a broader social *raison d'etre*
	- There must be a role to fill
**Telegraph**
- Competences required:
	- Ability to convert language to electricity
	- Purposes being shifted
	- Social structure with people in a place where they want to communicate across distances
	- British colonialism
- Colonial powers develop optical telegraphs, maintain control over citizens
	- Repeat of French Revolution is **not** ideal
- **Wedgewood**
	- Comes up with scheme using electrical signalling 1814
	- Admirality says no
- **Francis Ronald**
	- Scheme 1816, synchronized clock faces, letters of the alphabet, hitting letter sounding a pulse to other
	- Admiralty says no
	- Stating that due to semophore, telepgraphs are no longer needed socially
**- The invention of the Galvanometer
- Little device that suspends needle on silk thread, responds to current
- Early 1820s
- Same time as steam engine locomotive
- Social need for trains not crashing emerges
- galvanometer was invented independently multiple times
- Multiple men attribute to development of telegraph, due to galvanometer and social need to not crash trains
- Realized messages can be transported 
- ****No point in talking about who was first, it all emerges from the 'soup'**
- **Enter Morse**
	- Born 1791, graduates from Yale 1810
	- Futzed around with electricity, studied painting
	- Became a painter to prominent american presidents
	- Can't solve problem of constant power
	- Uses social connections to meet Joseph Henry, learns about how you can use magnets and sequential circuits to keep message going
	- Morse uses galvanometer with single circuit, eliminating distance through relays
	- Decided code would be more efficient [@dooleyIntroductionRevolutionaryCipher2018sourcenote](@dooleyIntroductionRevolutionaryCipher2018sourcenote.md)
	- US military put out reward for telegraph system across coast
		- Was given reward with tight deadline
		- Baltimore -> Washington = one of the first telegraph lines, buries it using pipe
		- Wire burns out first few tests
		- Friend suggests stringing up the wire through trees
		- Beats deadline, gets message through
- Are there forces pushing against technology?
